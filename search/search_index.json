In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a basic project from scratch in Rust. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to compile and run a Hello COMP423 example. Along the way, you'll also learn how to set up a git repository (git repo) and basic Rust development container (dev container) in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).</p> <p>Why Rust?</p> <p>Rust is a compiled programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety (all references point to valid memory) without a traditional garbage collecter. It is popular for systems programming. </p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>Before we get started, make sure you have everything needed for this tutorial: 1.
